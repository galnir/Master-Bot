### IMPORTANT : *DO NOT SKIP THIS STEPS AND DO NOT DELETE THEM. WE CAN NOT HELP YOU IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION AND STEPS TO REPRODUCE*

Do not open an issue if you simply "copied" code over to your bot/another bot. This is absolutely not recommended and will cause bugs. Also do not open an issue if you modified code and added features and now it's not working right. This is because I can't figure it out and don't have the time to read your code and find out what you did wrong.
